    q: "Do I need to create an account to view a board?",
    a: "No. Boards are public by default — anyone with the link can view the recommendations without signing up."
  },
  {
    q: "What can I use this app to recommend?",
    a: "You can create boards for anything you love — from anime, manga, games, music, books, movies, podcasts, to travel spots or niche collections."
  },
  {
    q: "Is the app free to use?",
    a: "Yes! You can sign up and create up to 3 boards for free, each with unlimited recommendations."
  },
  {
    q: "What do I get with the Pro upgrade?",
    a: "The Pro plan unlocks the ability to create unlimited boards and gives you early access to upcoming features. It's a one-time upgrade for those who want to support the app."
  },
  {
    q: "How do I share a board?",
    a: "Click the three dots on the board, then click 'Copy link'. The public link will be copied to your clipboard, which you can then share with anyone."
  },
  {
    q: "What about privacy?",
    a: "Your data is never shared with third parties. You can delete your account and all associated data at any time from your account settings."
